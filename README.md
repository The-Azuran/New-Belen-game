#Belen Torres Preaching The Truth
Welcome to the repository for "Belen Torres Preaching The Truth"! This game puts you in the shoes of a door-to-door preacher, whose mission is to convert as many souls as possible to your chosen faith.

Gameplay
In this game, you'll encounter various responses from people behind the doors of a neighborhood, and your performance will be scored based on the number of souls won.

Each day you will face different challenges, and your hunger will increase as you continue preaching. When your hunger reaches 100, the day ends and you must go home to rest.

You can choose to preach for one of the following religions: Evangelist, Jehovah's Witness, Mormon, or Custom. Each choice will lead to unique experiences, and there might be some surprises in store for those who dare to explore different paths...
